# Transfer Learning with PyTorch
Welcome to the Transfer Learning with PyTorch repository. This project demonstrates how to use transfer learning techniques with PyTorch to build and fine-tune neural networks on new tasks. Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models, allowing you to achieve better performance with limited data.

**Notebook Contents**

The notebook is organized as follows:

- Introduction to Transfer Learning: An overview of transfer learning and its benefits.
- Loading Data: Instructions on how to load and preprocess the dataset.
- Using Pre-trained Models: Details on how to use models pre-trained on large datasets.
- Modifying the Classifier: How to modify the final layer of the pre-trained model to suit the new task.
- Training the Model: Steps to train the model on the new dataset.
- Evaluating the Model: How to evaluate the model's performance on the validation/test set.
- Visualizing the Results: Techniques to visualize the results and feature maps.
