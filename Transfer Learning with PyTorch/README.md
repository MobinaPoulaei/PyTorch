# Transfer Learning with PyTorch
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to implement transfer learning using PyTorch. Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning where a pre-trained model is used as the starting point for a new task. This approach is particularly useful when you have limited data for the new task, as it allows you to leverage the knowledge learned from a larger dataset.

**Notebook Contents**
The notebook is organized as follows:

- Introduction to Transfer Learning: An overview of transfer learning and its benefits.
- Loading Data: Instructions on how to load and preprocess the dataset.
- Using Pre-trained Models: Details on how to use models pre-trained on large datasets.
- Modifying the Classifier: How to modify the final layer of the pre-trained model to suit the new task.
- Training the Model: Steps to train the model on the new dataset.
- Evaluating the Model: How to evaluate the model's performance on the validation/test set.
- Visualizing the Results: Techniques to visualize the results and feature maps.
