# Introduction to PyTorch
Welcome to the PyTorch repository. This repository provides a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that introduces the basics of PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. The notebook is designed to help beginners understand the fundamental concepts and operations of PyTorch.

As you know, PyTorch is a deep learning framework that is both powerful and easy to use. It provides Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that serves as an introductory guide to PyTorch, covering its core components and functionality.
