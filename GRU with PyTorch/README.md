# GRU with PyTorch

This code demonstrates how to implement a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) using PyTorch. GRUs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that are widely used in various sequence modeling tasks due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies in data.

**Introduction**

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building and training a GRU model with PyTorch. The GRU model is designed to handle sequential data and is particularly useful in tasks like time series forecasting, natural language processing, and more.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this notebook is a time series dataset. The notebook includes code to load and preprocess the dataset, making it suitable for training the GRU model. Ensure that your dataset is in a compatible format, such as a CSV file, and properly preprocessed before feeding it into the model.

**Model Architecture**

The GRU model is implemented using PyTorch's nn.GRU module. The architecture consists of the following components:

- An embedding layer to convert input data into dense vectors.
- A GRU layer to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
- A fully connected (linear) layer to map the output of the GRU to the desired output shape.
- The notebook provides detailed code and explanations for each part of the model.

**Training the Model**

Key steps involved in the training process are:

- Initializing the model, loss function, and optimizer.
- Forward pass: feeding the input data through the model to obtain predictions.
- Calculating the loss between predictions and actual values.
- Backward pass: updating the model parameters to minimize the loss.
- Evaluating the model on a validation set to monitor its performance.
